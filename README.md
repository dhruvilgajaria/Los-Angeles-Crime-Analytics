Exploratory Data Analysis of crime in the Los Angeles region

This project presents a detailed analysis of crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department, spanning from 2010 to 2019, and sourced from lacity.org. The dataset, with over 1.3 million records, offers a comprehensive view of various crime facets in Los Angeles, including crime types, locations, victim demographics, and involved weapons. Key aspects of the analysis include calculating average law enforcement response times, examining crime clearance rates, and analyzing victim demographics such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Additionally, the study delves into location and weapon analyses to identify the most affected areas and commonly used weapons in crimes. Trend analyses on specific types of crimes, including drug, hate, and gun-related incidents, are conducted to observe patterns over the years. The project also features a heatmap visualization of crime hotspots using Folium, providing a clear visual representation of high-crime areas. Finally, the analysis identifies the most common premises for criminal activities, offering insights into where crimes are most likely to occur. This multi-dimensional approach to crime data analysis aims to provide valuable insights for law enforcement, policymakers, and the public, enhancing understanding of crime patterns and trends in Los Angeles.
